## Lesson 1 - Drawing the app macro

Even though, the fact of drawing the app as we expect it to be, with header, main, etc, it is a trivial thing. It is very
important for our general structure understanding. Every time, before start to code an app, and create our components,
it is a good approach to always do that sort of drawing, since it is really good for us to visualize the future of the
app, how it will be componentized, if the components won't be coupled full of responsibilities, if it won't be a hard
app to maintain, and so on.

Therefore, every time we receive an app/layout to build, we should always make that macro drawing first, since in big
majority of times, people end up creating apps that are hard to scale.

Assume we create a version 1.0 of the app on "blank", we might think that it is complete, but then comes another functionalities
to implement, and we see that it is hard to implement on that version, which would even lead to discarding a great part
of the app. If the app is too coupled, without a well defined data flow, separation of responsibilities, and so on.
Having this ability, adding it to our repertoire, it is always a good approach.
