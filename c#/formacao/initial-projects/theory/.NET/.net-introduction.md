## What is .Net?

### What is the difference between C# and .NET?

C# is the programming language, .NET is a platform composed of multiple libraries.

Imagine we are going to create an app and everything we need to create to use in our app, we have to write it from scratch
from C#. We can utilize libraries out-of-the-box, using their behavior or even extending their behavior/functionalities
to customize on our own libraries. 

This is what .NET provides for us. It is composed by multiple libraries, and by the time we create our project, we simply
have to choose the type of project we want. If we want a project to execute as it was an app, for android, ios, or a
desktop app, project to create our APIs, and so on. Depending on the type of project we want to create, we can utilize
after it.

These libraries are written in C#. However, inside .NET we can utilize two other languages that it supports: VB, F#.
