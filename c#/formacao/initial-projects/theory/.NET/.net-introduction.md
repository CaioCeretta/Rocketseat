# Lesson 1 - What is #NET

## What is the difference between C# and .NET?

C# is the programming language, .NET is a platform composed of multiple libraries.

Imagine we are going to create an app and everything we need to create to use in our app, we have to write it from scratch
from C#. We can utilize libraries out-of-the-box, using their behavior or even extending their behavior/functionalities
to customize on our own libraries. 

This is what .NET provides for us. It is composed by multiple libraries, and by the time we create our project, we simply
have to choose the type of project we want. If we want a project to execute as it was an app, for android, ios, or a
desktop app, project to create our APIs, and so on. Depending on the type of project we want to create, we can utilize
after it.

These libraries are written in C#. However, inside .NET we can utilize two other languages that it supports: VB, F#.

### Main Functionalities

Async Code, Lambda Functions, Garbage Collectors, Link (DB).

### Versions

Every month of november, a new .NET version is released. But we need to be cautious, mainly if we are in a corporative
environment.

On odd years, they release a LTS (Long Term Support) version , and microsoft will only supports this version foe three
years.
On even years, they release a STS (Standard Term Support) version, and microsoft will only support this version for
18 months.

## .NET history

In 2002, Microsoft released a set of libraries, and named this platform as '.NET Framework'. However, that library only
executes on windows environments. In 2014, it released the platform '.NET Core', that was open source and multi
platform.

.NET Core was named like this until version 3.1. But starting from version 3.1, Microsoft decided to remove the word
Core and launched the .NET 5.

# Lesson 2 - Compilation and Execution

Let's use our "Hello, world" project as example. What happens when we execute that project:

1st of all, the build of our project runs, and then, it will execute that builded project.

## Build

Essentially, the build checks if there is no syntax error, if all the functions being called exist, if they are being
called in the correct form, if no semi colon was forgotten, etc. In a good scenario, where everything is correct, .NET
will get our code written in C#, and transform it into a file with the '.dll' extension.

The .dll file will obtain our source code, and transform it into another language (which is called an intermediate language),
that 'il' is nothing more than a light, compact, and independent from the platform language. By platform or architecture
we are talking about OS,  the available memory, cpu type, and so on. This means that, if we are executing it in linux,
get the file after the build, which will be "ProjectName.dll", and send it to someone using windows, if that person
execute the same dll in different OS's, it will work. It is still our code, but it hasn't been transformed into a native
code. 

## Execution

In the execution, we enter in another concept called CLR (Common Language Runtime). The CLR gets the code, that is in
an intermediate language, and convert it to native code. Native codes take into consideration which is the OS being dealt
with, the CPU being used,  etc. 

When it converts to that native code, it finally executes and show us the result. Understand that CLR as if it was a virtual
machine. It essentially gets the code in il, converts it in that virtual machine to native code, and then, execute it.

Each OS has its own CLR. 

## Hello World Example

### Bin Folder

Inside this folder, there are some files, we will find our .dll file generated by the build, and if we run the dotnet
command on the cmd, on this dll file, we will be able to execute it like it would on visual studio. This already gets
the dll via `clr`, converts into native code, and then shows the results.

When we build console projects, it will also create a `.exe` file. However, if we double click that file. It will open
the window, and quickly close it. So if we want to keep it open, we have to execute it via cmd.

### Publish command

The publish command, when we publish it in the cloud, for example, it will create only one folder, with all the dlls, and
necessary file. It creates a different dll for each project.

We may have multiple bin folders inside multiple nested projects. And this publish will get all of these dlls, put inside
one folder, and publish it in a given server.



## Two new acronyms

In .NET we may encounter two acronyms. We already saw il, CLR, and there are two others

1. JIT (Just in time)

It is a compiler that will transform, only in execution time, our dll to a native code.

or

2. AOT (Ahead of time)



An anticipation, it will compile our code to the native language, and the .exe is a product of this.
