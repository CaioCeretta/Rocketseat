## Lesson 1 - API project creation

Inside visual studio `Create New Project` window, choose the `ASP .NET Core Web API` option. Fill the options, rename
as we want, click next and create the project.

For this initial project, we delete the `WeatherForecast.cs` file and its Controllers file that is automatically created
by VS to start a clean project.
