## What is CSharp?

C# is a high level language, which means it is a programming language that is very similar to the human language, and not
to the machine language.

It is a language destined to be simple, modern, and economic, concerning the memory consume and processing. It is not
a direct contestant of lower level languages, like C and Assembly.

With C# we can create a great variety of softwares with different objectives. Like APIs, Apps for windows, mac, android
and IOS, and we are also able to create our own websites.

Some of its characteristics are:

Object Oriented: Everything in C# is an object, which is great for organizing and sharing our code.
Memory Management: C# already equipped with a garbage collector, that runs automatically and we do not have to worry with
liberating memory, and it will, itself, notice that there is a memory space that isn't being used anymore for a variable
and deletes it.
Typed language
Security: It's widely used inside corporate environments.

## Differences between C, C++, and C#

### C vs C++: 

The relationship between C and C++ is the most direct; C++ is essentially an extension of C.

**C**: C is a procedural language. It focuses on a sequence of steps (procedures or functions) to compute something. It's
often called a "middle-level" language because it offers close access to hardware and memory.

**C++**: C++ is a multi-paradigm language. It keeps all the procedural power of C but introduces the ability to organize
code around objects (data structures and methods that operate on that data). This is the main difference.

### C/C++ vs. C#

C# is a much newer language, developed by Microsoft, and its philosophy is very different from its predecessors.

• **C#** is a modern, object-oriented language that runs in a managed environment (the CLR). This environment provides
services like the Garbage Collector, which eliminates most manual memory management and its associated bugs (a major
source of headaches in C and C++).

• **C#** focuses on developer productivity and safety, trading some of the raw, low-level control of C/C++ for a safer,
more robust framework.

### Summary

In short

**C**: The original, procedural, low-level language.
**C++**: C plus OOP
**C#**: Is a managed, modern OOP language,  build for the .NET framework, prioritizing safety and rapid development over
C/C++'s raw hardware access
